# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), an annual programming event featuring fun and challenging puzzles released daily from December 1st to 25th. This repository contains my Python solutions for various years.

## Repository Structure
- Each year has its own directory (e.g., `2024/`).
- Within each year:
  - Solutions are organized as `dayXX.py` files, where `XX` corresponds to the day of the puzzle.
  - A `utils.py` file provides helper functions for common tasks, such as reading inputs, parsing data, or other repetitive operations.

## Note on Inputs
Puzzle input files are not included in this repository in accordance with Advent of Code's [Terms of Service](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about). If you'd like to run these solutions with your inputs, you'll need to supply them yourself. The `utils.py` file can assist in handling input files and other utility tasks.

## Goals
- Practice Python programming.
- Tackle challenging and creative coding problems.
- Celebrate the holiday season with some coding fun!

Feel free to browse the solutions for inspiration or to compare approaches. ðŸŽ…âœ¨
